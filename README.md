# Daft Punk Helmet

This source includes the Arduino code (misnamed matrix test), the image converter, and the ionic app source.

### Installation

Build the ionic app, use http://redbearlab.com/bleshield/ and a https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMega2560 (you can use a regular Arduino but you have to limit the amount of faces since they're not pulled in dynamically, they are held in ram)

Run it, discover the helmet with the app, tap on a face, enjoy.

### Hardware

I used a 22,000 miliamp portable charget with the 1A usb to arduino for power. Lasted me like 4 or 5 hours, with plenty of juice left. 

I originally was playing with the Raspberry pi, but the power consumption was a lot greater.
